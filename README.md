### About Me
My interest in cybersecurity started during a bachelor's course that completely changed my perspective.  
Thanks to a professor who provided the right insights and challenges, I discovered how fascinating this field can be, where logic, creativity, and precision meet to protect what matters most.  

Since then, I’ve been exploring different areas of cybersecurity, from hands-on challenges to broader reflections on privacy, trust, and resilience in digital environments.
